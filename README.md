- Led toogling (from scratch without using "stm32f4xx.h" library)
- Led toogling (using "stm32f4xx.h" library)
- Adc
- Systick delay
- Timers
- GPIO Output comparison
- GPIO Input capture
- GPIO Input interrupt
- UART RX interrupt
- ADC interrupt
- Systick interrupt
- Timer interrupt
- UART TX DMA
- I2C/SPI using ADXL345 accelerometer:
